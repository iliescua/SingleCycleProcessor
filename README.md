# SingleCycleProcessor

This was a project for my computer architecture freshman year
I designed and built a single cycle processor from scratch using Quartus 
I provide a memory file that would send commands to the processor so that I could simulate what would happen
This allowed me to confirm that the SCP worked properly and that it would output the correct results by verifying the results with waveforms
